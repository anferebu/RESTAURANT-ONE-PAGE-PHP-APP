# Restaurant-One-Page-PHP-App

Web PHP App designed for a Restaurant.  the App can interact with the browser dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of loading entire new pages.  Using the navigation buttons, the user will be able to see the Home page, the Team, the Menu (When the user enters to the menu, the user will be able to click every dish in the menu and see its description, price, suggested drink and suggested tip).  Finally in the contact option, the user is going to see a submission form to contact the owners of the business and send a message to them.

A warning message in the footer of the page, informs the user if the restaurant is open or closed (When the restaurant is open, the message appears in green color and when the restaurant is closed the restaurant appears in red color).  The implementation of this function is possible using the php-store-hours-master class that updates and calculates automatically the current time, depending of the geographical location of the Restaurant.  This class is an open-source class and its available for developers online.
